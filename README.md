### About
A repository consisting of DSA implementations in **C++**

### Features
- 🗃️ Well organized code in directories
- ⚙️ Proper build system with CMake, make, and g++
- ⚡ Generic class and function definitions (ready for use)
- 🧪 Test Cases for all implementations
- ⏱️ Documentation of space and time complexities

### How to run (Data Structures)
**Make sure that you have CMake, make, and g++ installed**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fanny6213-web/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git
cd Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
```
From here you can browse all the data structures or algorithms which you want  
1. Just go inside the folder and you will find a main.cpp file
2. Open up your terminal in this folder
3. Now:
```bash
cd build
make
./<Name of the compiled file>
```
Instructions for algorithms coming soon...
